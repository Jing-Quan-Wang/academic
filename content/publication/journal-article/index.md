abstract: Ultraviolet (UV)/chlor(am)ine processes are emerging advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for water decontamination and raising continuous attention. However, limitations appear in the UV/hypochlorite and UV/monochloramine for removing specific contaminants ascribed to the differences in the sorts and yields of free radicals. Here, this study reports UV/dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) as a novel source of radicals. NaDCC was demonstrated to be a well-balanced compound between hypochlorite and monochloramine, and it had significant UV absorption and a medium intrinsic quantum yield. The UV/NaDCC produced more substantial hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and reactive chlorine species (RCSs, including Cl·, ClO·, and Cl2·–) than conventional UV/chlor(am)ine, thereby generating a higher oxidation efficiency. The reaction mechanisms, environmental applicability, and energy requirements of the UV/NaDCC process for emerging contaminants (ECs) abatement were further investigated. The results showed that ·OH and ·NH2 attacked ECs mostly through hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and radical adduct formation, whereas Cl· destroyed ECs mainly through HAT and single electron transfer, with ClO· playing a certain role through HAT. Kinetic model analyses revealed that the UV/NaDCC outperformed the conventional UV/chlor(am)ine in a variety of water matrices with superior degradation efficiency, significantly saving up to 96% electrical energy per order. Overall, this study first demonstrates application prospects of a novel AOP using UV/NaDCC, which can compensate for the deficiency of the conventional UV/chlor(am)ine AOPs.
